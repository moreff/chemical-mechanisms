Note: the transport parameters file contains updated binary diffusion coefficients. The data in its current format are not yet accepted by any versions of Chemkin available from Reaction Design. Please contact the authors to obtain Chemkin equivalent subroutines that can accommodate these newly compiled diffusion coefficients. The transport revisions impact only the hydrogen flame speeds only. The impact is generally within 5% with and without the update. The users may elect not to use the update by deleting the lines starting from "End" in the transport parameters file.
